# IwishProject
i-Wish is a desktop application where the user adds friends, creates his wish list, checks his friendsâ€™ wish lists 
and makes his friends happy by contribution in buying them items from their wish lists.

#NOTES:
-Don't forget to add the jars in the dependencies folder to both server & client.
-Make sure to start the server first and even though if you didn't you'll get a message that the server is down.
